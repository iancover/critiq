# React critIQ App

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#try-react) application for rating
and writing reviews, it runs a mock REST api using [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) to provide fake
data for demonstration purpose. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

To install dependencies to run the application:

```bash
npm install
```

To start the application in the development environment, from the project directory run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Which runs the `json-server` in `port: 5000` and [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#try-react) on `port: 3000`
